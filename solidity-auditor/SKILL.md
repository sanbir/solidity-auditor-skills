# Smart Contract Security Audit

You are the orchestrator of a parallelized smart contract security audit. Your job is to discover in-scope files, spawn scanning agents, then merge and deduplicate their findings into a single report.

## Mode Selection

**Exclude pattern** (applies to all modes): skip directories `interfaces/`, `lib/`, `mocks/`, `test/` and files matching `*.t.sol`, `*Test*.sol` or `*Mock*.sol`.

- **Default** (no arguments): scan all `.sol` files using the exclude pattern. Use Bash `find` (not Glob) to discover files.
- **deep**: same scope as default, but also spawns the adversarial reasoning agent (Agent 5) and the DeFi protocol agent (Agent 6). Use for thorough reviews. Slower and more costly.
- **`$filename ...`**: scan the specified file(s) only.

**Flags:**

- `--file-output` (off by default): also write the report to a markdown file (path per `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`). Without this flag, output goes to the terminal only. Never write a report file unless the user explicitly passes `--file-output`.

## Constraints (optional)

If a `.pashov-skills-constraints.yaml` file exists in the repository root, the orchestrator reads it during discovery and includes it in every agent bundle. Agents use declared constraints to fast-track **Skip** classification during triage. Constraints describe factual codebase properties, not security assumptions. Code overrides constraints.

Supported fields (all optional, unknown fields ignored):

```yaml
tokens: [USDC, WETH]              # accepted token list (skip exotic-token vectors if set)
standards: [ERC20]                 # implemented standards (skip unlisted standard vectors)
cross_chain: false                 # no bridge/LayerZero/cross-chain logic
proxy_pattern: none                # none | transparent | uups | diamond | beacon
oracle: chainlink                  # chainlink | twap | pyth | custom | none
account_abstraction: false         # no ERC-4337 / smart account logic
```

## Orchestration

**Turn 1 — Discover.** Print the banner, then in the same message make parallel tool calls: (a) Bash `find` for in-scope `.sol` files per mode selection, (b) Glob for `**/references/attack-vectors/attack-vectors-1.md` and extract the `references/` directory path (two levels up), (c) Read `.pashov-skills-constraints.yaml` from the repository root (if not found, continue without constraints). Use this resolved path as `{resolved_path}` for all subsequent references.

**Turn 2 — Prepare.** In a single message, make three parallel tool calls: (a) Read `{resolved_path}/agents/vector-scan-agent.md`, (b) Read `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`, (c) Bash: create five per-agent bundle files (`/tmp/audit-agent-{1,2,3,4,5}-bundle.md`) in a **single command** — if constraints were found in Turn 1, each bundle starts with a `## Constraints` section containing the raw YAML content; then concatenate **all** in-scope `.sol` files (with `### path` headers and fenced code blocks), then `{resolved_path}/judging.md`, then `{resolved_path}/report-formatting.md`, then `{resolved_path}/attack-vectors/attack-vectors-N.md`; print line counts. Every agent receives the full codebase — only the attack-vectors file differs per agent. Do NOT read or inline any file content into agent prompts — the bundle files replace that entirely.

**Turn 3 — Spawn.** In a single message, spawn all agents as parallel foreground Agent tool calls (do NOT use `run_in_background`). Always spawn Agents 1–5. Only spawn Agents 6 and 7 when the mode is **DEEP**.

- **Agents 1–5** (vector scanning) — spawn with `model: "sonnet"`. Each agent prompt must contain the full text of `vector-scan-agent.md` (read in Turn 2, paste into every prompt). After the instructions, add: `Your bundle file is /tmp/audit-agent-N-bundle.md (XXXX lines).` (substitute the real line count).
- **Agent 6** (adversarial reasoning, DEEP only) — spawn with `model: "opus"`. Receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: your reference directory is `{resolved_path}`. If constraints were found in Turn 1, also include: the constraints file is at `.pashov-skills-constraints.yaml` in the repository root. Read `{resolved_path}/agents/adversarial-reasoning-agent.md` for your full instructions.
- **Agent 7** (DeFi protocol analysis, DEEP only) — spawn with `model: "opus"`. Receives the in-scope `.sol` file paths and the instruction: your reference directory is `{resolved_path}`. Read `{resolved_path}/agents/defi-protocol-agent.md` for your full instructions.

**Turn 4 — Report.** Merge all agent results: deduplicate by root cause (keep the higher-confidence version), sort by confidence highest-first, re-number sequentially, and insert the **Below Confidence Threshold** separator row. Print findings directly — do not re-draft or re-describe them. Use report-formatting.md (read in Turn 2) for the scope table and output structure. If constraints were loaded, add a **Constraints** row to the scope table showing the declared values. If `--file-output` is set, write the report to a file (path per report-formatting.md) and print the path.
